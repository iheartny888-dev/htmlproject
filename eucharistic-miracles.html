                <h3>Eucharistic Miracles</h3>
                <p>Extraordinary manifestations of Christ's presence in the Blessed Sacrament have been reported since the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper. These phenomena, known as Eucharistic miracles, often involve the physical transformation of the consecrated host into human flesh. These signs affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Such miracles have been increasingly documented in recent centuries, due in large part to the advancement of scientific analysis of such phenomena. There are over 150 recognized Eucharistic miracles to date. The AB blood type which is consistent across all Eucharistic miracles was a common blood type among ancient Jews, although it is relatively rare today.</p>

                <h3>Miracle of Lanciano</h3>
                <p class="date">750 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Lanciano, Italy</em></p>
                <p class="text">According to tradition, a Basilian monk who had doubted the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist celebrated Mass. At the moment of consecration, the monk saw the bread turn visibly into flesh, and the wine visibly into blood. The blood then coagulated into five globules, symbolizing the five wounds of Christ. The relics have since been preserved and remain to this day. In 1970, scientific studies on the miracle were authorized by Church authorities. Dr. Odoardo Linoli, an anatomist, histologist, and expert in clinical microscopy, conducted a study in which he reported that the content of the host was, in factm, human tissue. The tissue was identified as myocardium, heart muscle, and it exhibited multiple signs of severe distress consistent with the accounts of the suffering of Jesus. Microscopic examination revealed intact muscle fibers, white blood cells, which ordinarily cannot exist outside of the body, and evidence of blood clots, all indicating that the tissue had been alive at the time it was preserved. The blood type was AB, which was consistent with that of the Shroud of Turin.</p>

                <h3>Miracle of Buenos Aires</h3>
                <p class="date">August 18, 1996 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Buenos Aires, Argentina</em></p>
                <p class="text">In 1996, during Mass at the Church of St. Mary, a consecrated host fell to the ground during Communion. The priest, following the directives of the Church, placed the Host into a vessel full of water, waiting for it to dissolve. When the tabernacle was opened a few days later, it was found that the Host had not dissolved, but rather a red substance had spread throughout the water, resembling blood. The Host did not decompose, even after several years, prompting Bishop Jorge Bergoglio, who would later become Pope Francis, to order a scientific investigation into the phenomenon. Dr. Richard Gomez, a clinical psychologiist and researcher, conducted an investigation. Blind samples were sent to Dr. Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist and cardiologist, who identified the material as human myocardium from the left ventricle. The tissue showed signs of inflammation and trauma, with a large number of white blood cells present, suggesting it came from a living, stressed heart. The blood type was determined to be AB. Later Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of mesenchymal cells, which suggested heart muscle in severe distress.</p>

                <p class="text">During Mass at the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, a consecrated host fell to the ground. Similarly to the miracle in Buenos Aires, the priest placed the Host in a vessel of water only to discover the presence of blood in the vessel. The phenomenon was meticulously documented and preserved by the parish. In 2012, Bishop Antoni Dydcz authorized scientific investigation into the phenomenon. Dr. Łukasz Zdanowicz conducted a histological analysis of the phenomenon. The results identified the substance as myocardium from the left ventricle. The tissue exhibited signs of acute stress and trauma, with a large concentration of white blood cells present. The blood type was determined to be AB. Medical experts noted that the preservation of the tissue outside the body, without decomposition, was scientifically inexplicable. Later immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of myocardium in severe distress.</p>
