                <h3>Eucharistic Miracles</h3>
                <p>Extraordinary manifestations of Christ's presence in the Blessed Sacrament have been reported since the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper. These phenomena, known as Eucharistic miracles, often involve the physical transformation of the consecrated host into human flesh. These signs affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Such miracles have been increasingly documented in recent centuries, due in large part to the advancement of scientific analysis of such phenomena. There are over 150 recognized Eucharistic miracles to date.</p>

                <h3>Miracle of Lanciano</h3>
                <p class="date">750 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Lanciano, Italy</em></p>
                <p class="text">According to tradition, a Basilian monk who had doubted the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist celebrated Mass. At the moment of consecration, the monk saw the bread turn visibly into flesh, and the wine visibly into blood. The blood then coagulated into five globules, symbolizing the five wounds of Christ. The relics have since been preserved and remain to this day. In 1970, scientific studies on the miracle were authorized by Church authorities. Dr. Odoardo Linoli, an anatomist, histologist, and expert in clinical microscopy, conducted a study in which he reported that the content of the host was, in factm, uman tissue. The tissue was identified as myocardium, heart muscle,</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of Fatima</h3>
                <p class="date">October 13, 1917 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Fatima, Portugal</em></p>
                <p class="text">Three children, from the small village of Fatima, during the first World War, were visited by the Virgin Mary. She told them to pray the rosary daily for peace and the end of the war. They were told to return on the 13th day of the following 5 months. The next month, the children again witnessed an apparition of Mary, who told them that two of the three children, Francisco and Jacinta, would soon be taken to Heaven, while the third, Lucia, would remain on Earth to help spread devotion to her Immaculate Heart. The next month, the children received a vision of Hell and a prophecy that, should humanity fail to turn back to God, another war would begin in the aftermath of the first World War. Mary requested that Russia, which was at the time ruled by the Tsar, be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart, and three secrets were revealed to the children, later fully published by the Vatican.</p>
                <p class="text">Mary told the children that a great miracle would occur in October, so that all would believe. The children, after spreading their message, were detained by local authorities, but Mary appeared again, urging prayer and sacrifice. The next month, Mary again promised a great miracle in October, and on the final month, with as many as 70,000 people gathered in the pouring rain at Fatima, the sun began to behave very strangely. It spun in the sky, gave off multicolored lights, and even plunged towards the Earth. People's previously soaked clothes were immediately made dry, and people were amazed. Even prominent atheists in the city admitted that a miracle had occurred, and the local bishop was sure of the vision's miraculous origin. The first secret, the vision of Hell, and the second secret, a second world war and the spread of Russia's "errors" (later recognized as atheistic communism), were revealed soon after the Miracle of the Sun.</p>
                <p class="text">The third secret was revealed by the Vatican in 2000, and depicted the pope being assassinated. Both Lucia and the Vatican attributed this vision to the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981. In 1984, Russia was consecrated by the pope to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary. Immediately following the consecration, Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power within the Soviet Union, easing Cold War tensions and ultimately leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lucia believed that, had Russia not been consecrated at this date, nuclear war would have broken out under Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. This apparition demonstrates Mary's dedication to repentance and the protection of the faithful.</p>
