                <h3>Marian Apparitions</h3>
                <p>Since the death, resurrection, and transfiguration of Christ, physical manifestations of Mary have appeared to tens of thousands of people. In recent centuries, such apparitions have become increasingly common, due in part to greater interconnectedness and access to information. Scholars estimate that 2,500 independent Marian Apparitions have occurred throughout history, 308 of which have been attributed to saints or other holy individuals. 7 Popes have, themselves, witnessed a Marian apparition.</p>

                <h3><strong>Our Lady of the Pillar</strong></h3>
                <p class="date">January 2, 40 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Zaragoza, Spain</em></p>
                <p class="text">According to tradition, the Apostle James was preaching in Roman Hispania, praying on the Ebro river, when Mary appeared on a nearby pillar, accompanied by thousands of Angels. This is the only recorded instance of the bilocation of Mary, whereby she was alive in Jerusalem at the time of the apparition. The feast day of this apparition coincides with the discovery of America, prompting Mary to receive the title of 'Patroness of the Hispanic World.' This apparition is the very first to occur in Christian history, marking a turning point, and emphasizing Mary's support of the missionary efforts of the Apostles.</p>

                <p class="text">A widow named Villa, who was a new convert, became very sick with a high fever. Villa prayed to the Virgin Mary, who appeared to her, telling her to climb Mount Anis to be healed. Villa had her servant carry her to the place indicated, where she was placed on a nearby rock. Villa fell asleep, experiencing a dream in which an angel told her that Mary had chosen that very rock to be invoked upon. Villa was completely healed, and rushed to tell the bishop, Saint George of Velay. A fence was built around the rock, and later it became the location of a new church alter. The apparition represents Mary's unceasing care for the sick and lowly.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of the Snows</h3>
                <p class="date">August 4, 352 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Rome, Italy</em></p>
                <p class="text">A wealthy, childless, Roman couple, during the pntificate of Pope Liberius, prayed to the Virgin Mary, asking how they should use their fortune in a way pleasing to God. Both Pope Liberius and the couple had a dream that night in which the Virgin Mary told them to build a church in her honor on a place she would show them. The next morning, at the height of summer, snow blanketed the top of Esquiline Hill in Rome. The outline of the snow formed the shape of a church. Pope Liberius ordered the construction of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the four major basillicas of Rome, and the wealthy couple funded its construction. This demonstrates Mary's support for charity. generousity, and the growth of the Church.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of Covadonga</h3>
                <p class="date">May 28, 722 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Covadonga, Spain</em></p>
                <p class="text">After the Islamic conquest of much of the Iberian peninsula, a small group of Christians, led by Pelayo, a local nobleman, hid away in the mountains of Asturias. In 722, the Asturians faced a major battle against the Muslim invaders. Pelayo prayed before a statue of the Virgin Mary and she appeared to him, stating that his cause was just and that he would be victorious despite his forces being outnumbered. On the day of the battle, enemy arrows bounced off the rock face and turned towards the attackers. The Christians saw hundreds of angels pushing the large rocks on the top of the mountain onto the Muslims, causing them to retreat and leading to the first Christian victory of the Reconquista. This apparition demonstrates Mary's devotion to the defense of Christendom and of the faith.</p>
