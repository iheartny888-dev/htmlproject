                <h3>Marian Apparitions</h3>
                <p>Since the death, resurrection, and transfiguration of Christ, physical manifestations of Mary have appeared to tens of thousands of people. In recent centuries, such apparitions have become increasingly common, due in part to greater interconnectedness and access to information. Scholars estimate that 2,500 independent Marian Apparitions have occurred throughout history, 308 of which have been attributed to saints or other holy individuals. 7 Popes have, themselves, witnessed a Marian apparition.</p>

                <p class="text">According to tradition, the Apostle James was preaching in Roman Hispania, praying on the Ebro river, when Mary appeared on a nearby pillar, accompanied by thousands of Angels. This is the only recorded instance of the bilocation of Mary, whereby she was alive in Jerusalem at the time of the apparition. The feast day of this apparition coincides with the discovery of America, prompting Mary to receive the title of 'Patroness of the Hispanic World.' This apparition is the very first to occur in Christian history, marking a turning point, and emphasizing Mary's support of the missionary efforts of the Apostles.</p>

                <p class="text">A widow named Villa, who was a new convert, became very sick with a high fever. Villa prayed to the Virgin Mary, who appeared to her, telling her to climb Mount Anis to be healed. Villa had her servant carry her to the place indicated, where she was placed on a nearby rock. Villa fell asleep, experiencing a dream in which an angel told her that Mary had chosen that very rock to be invoked upon. Villa was completely healed, and rushed to tell the bishop, Saint George of Velay. A fence was built around the rock, and later it became the location of a new church alter. The apparition represents Mary's unceasing care for the sick and lowly.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of the Snows</h3>
                <p class="date">August 4, 352 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Rome, Italy</em></p>
                <p class="text">A wealthy, childless, Roman couple, during the pntificate of Pope Liberius, prayed to the Virgin Mary, asking how they should use their fortune in a way pleasing to God. Both Pope Liberius and the couple had a dream that night in which the Virgin Mary told them to build a church in her honor on a place she would show them. The next morning, at the height of summer, snow blanketed the top of Esquiline Hill in Rome. The outline of the snow formed the shape of a church. Pope Liberius ordered the construction of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the four major basillicas of Rome, and the wealthy couple funded its construction. This demonstrates Mary's support for charity. generousity, and the growth of the Church.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of Covadonga</h3>
                <p class="date">May 28, 722 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Covadonga, Spain</em></p>
                <p class="text">After the Islamic conquest of much of the Iberian peninsula, a small group of Christians, led by Pelayo, a local nobleman, hid away in the mountains of Asturias. In 722, the Asturians faced a major battle against the Muslim invaders. Pelayo prayed before a statue of the Virgin Mary and she appeared to him, stating that his cause was just and that he would be victorious despite his forces being outnumbered. On the day of the battle, enemy arrows bounced off the rock face and turned towards the attackers. The Christians saw hundreds of angels pushing the large rocks on the top of the mountain onto the Muslims, causing them to retreat and leading to the first Christian victory of the Reconquista. This apparition demonstrates Mary's devotion to the defense of Christendom and of the faith.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of Guadalupe</h3>
                <p class="date">December 12, 1531 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Mexico City, Mexico</em></p>
                <p class="text">Our Lady of Guadalupe is among the most fascinating Marian apparitions. Saint Juan Diego, a poor, Aztec Indian who had recently converted, was on the hill of Tepeyac when the Virgin Mary appeared to him, asking him to have a shrine built at that very spot. Juan Diego rushed to the Archbishop, who dismissed the story and asked for proof of the miraculous apparition. Juan Diego returned to the hill and told Mary of the Archbishop's dismissal. She told him to gather flowers from around the hill and take them to the Archbishop. Although it was Winter, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers of a type he had never seen before. It was later determined that these were Castilian roses, which were native to Europe and could not grow in the Mexican climate.</p>
                <p class="text">He bundled the flowers in his tilma and ran to the Archbishop. When he presented the flowers to the Archbishop, they had withered and quickly fell to the ground. However, miraculously imprinted on the tilma was a colorful image of the Virgin Mary herself. This tilma, even after 500 years, has not deteriorated in the slightest, as it should have, being made of weak cactus fiber, and in fact we are consistently discovering new aspects of the tilma which point to its miraculous origin. The image depicts Mary crushing an Aztec god of human sacrifices. The stars on the purple cloak, which symbolizes royalty, match perfectly with the estimated position of the various stars at the time of the apparition. The ribbon at her waist signifies her virginity, but the placement of the same signifies pregnancy.</p>
                <p class="text">Analysis on the tilma has shown that the image has not been made with paint or any other substance which would have coated the original tilma. Instead the reason for the coloration cannot be determined, given that there is no difference in the chemical composition of the areas with different colors. Recent discoveries have shown that the eyes, which are slightly open on the tilma, contain images of people which would have been impossibly small details to create if it were a forgery. Furthermore, the slight shift in the orientation of the images in either eye matches exactly that of normal human eyes. These images are believed to be those of the Archbishop and those who were in the room at the time of the image's creation. This apparition demonstrates Mary's love and compassion for all people who believe, regardless of the skepticism of others.</p>

                <h3>Our Lady of Fatima</h3>
                <p class="date">October 13, 1917 AD</p>
                <p class="date"><em>Fatima, Portugal</em></p>
                <p class="text">Three children, from the small village of Fatima, during the first World War, were visited by the Virgin Mary. She told them to pray the rosary daily for peace and the end of the war. They were told to return on the 13th day of the following 5 months. The next month, the children again witnessed an apparition of Mary, who told them that two of the three children, Francisco and Jacinta, would soon be taken to Heaven, while the third, Lucia, would remain on Earth to help spread devotion to her Immaculate Heart. The next month, the children received a vision of Hell and a prophecy that, should humanity fail to turn back to God, another war would begin in the aftermath of the first World War. Mary requested that Russia, which was at the time ruled by the Tsar, be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart, and three secrets were revealed to the children, later fully published by the Vatican.</p>
                <p class="text">Mary told the children that a great miracle would occur in October, so that all would believe. The children, after spreading their message, were detained by local authorities, but Mary appeared again, urging prayer and sacrifice. The next month, Mary again promised a great miracle in October, and on the final month, with as many as 70,000 people gathered in the pouring rain at Fatima, the sun began to behave very strangely. It spun in the sky, gave off multicolored lights, and even plunged towards the Earth. People's previously soaked clothes were immediately made dry, and people were amazed. Even prominent atheists in the city admitted that a miracle had occurred, and the local bishop was sure of the vision's miraculous origin. The first secret, the vision of Hell, and the second secret, a second world war and the spread of Russia's "errors" (later recognized as atheistic communism), were revealed soon after the Miracle of the Sun.</p>
                <p class="text">The third secret was revealed by the Vatican in 2000, and depicted the pope being assassinated. Both Lucia and the Vatican attributed this vision to the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981. In 1984, Russia was consecrated by the pope to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary. Immediately following the consecration, Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power within the Soviet Union, easing Cold War tensions and ultimately leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lucia believed that, had Russia not been consecrated at this date, nuclear war would have broken out under Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. This apparition demonstrates Mary's dedication to repentance and the protection of the faithful.</p>
