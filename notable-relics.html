            <h3>Shroud of Turin</h3>
            <p>Throughout Christian history, objects associated with the lives of saints and other holy people have been venerated for their ability to inspire devotion and convey miraculous signs. These relics carry a tangible, metaphysical connection to the individuals to which they belonged, and serve as physical reminders of the divine. Scholars have documented thousands of authenticated relics, ranging from parts of a saint's body to items touched by saints. Numerous reports describe relics emitting inexplicable fragrances, healing the sick, or exhibiting supernatural phenomena.</p>
            <p>One such relic is the Shroud of Turin. This cloth, which bears the image of Jesus Christ, has been the subject of intense devotion, scientific investigation, and curiosity for centuries. The Shroud first appears in the historical record in the 6th Century, in the Mandylion of Edessa, where a cloth bearing a miraculous image of Christ's face is depicted. It appears later in 14th Century France, where a knight named Geoffroi de Charny exhibited a linen cloth bearing the image of a crucified man. In 1389, the Bishop of Troyes denounced the Shroud as a forgery, and by 1453, the Shroud had passed into the hands of the House of Savoy. The Shroud was then brought to Turin, Italy in 1578, where it remains today.</p>
            <p>The crucifixion wounds on the Shroud are remarkably consistent with both Roman practices around the time of Jesus and the accounts of his death. Blood flow on the Shroud is consistent with gravity on a vertical, crucified body and cause of death indicators such as thoracic effusion, collapsed lungs, and shoulder dislocations align with medical reconstructions of the crucifixion. A 2022 study using wide-angle X-ray scattering argued that the linen's degradation patterns were compatible with fabric originating from the 1st Century. The blood on the Shroud is type AB, which is associated with ancient Near Eastern populations and is consistent with Eucharistic miracles. The blood shows characteristics of hemolysis, high bilirubin, and trauma-related signs consistent with severe scourging and shock.</p>
            <p>The Shroud is woven in a 3:1 herringbone twill, a fairly sophisticated weave. The fiber composition of the Shroud also appears to be consistent with ancient Middle Eastern weaving techniques. Pollen grains, which are present on the Shroud, have been confirmed by multiple researchers to date back to the 1st century, and are of species native to the Judean desert region.</p>
            <p>The most stunning aspect of the Shroud is the image. It is not painted, as there are no pigments, binders, or brushstrokes which penetrate the fibers. The image exists only on the topmost fibrils (about 0.2 microns thick) which cannot be reproduced by any known medieval technique. The image acts like a photographic negative, which is unknown in pre-modern art. Surprisingly, the most repubtable hypothesis for the source of the image appears to be that a sudden, massive burst of radiation burnt the image into the Shroud. This hypothesis comes from the radiation-like discoloration present on the Shroud. The ENEA estimated that roughly 30 million joules of vacuum-ultraviolet light would be required to create the image. Such a feat is unachievable with modern technology. This evidence strongly suggests the truth of the Resurrection.</p>
